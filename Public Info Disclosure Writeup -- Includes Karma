During initial scans, the analyst located a web based login page at 207.104.165.95, port 443.  In some cases, externally facing login pages are unavoidable because organization's or personnel need to access the website from off-site; however, an attacker with enough time can run automated programs that try to log in using username and password combinations endlessly in accordance with the organization's lockout policy.

To provide a proof-of-concept for a brute force attack the analyst used a hacking tool set called Burpsuite to carry out a brute force attack using usernames and emails gathered via various intelligence gathering programs such as theHarvester, Discover Scripts, hunter.io, and karma (See figure %REF{52147}). The first figure below shows a brute force attack against the organization's email service. This attack was not successful; however, given unlimited time, a real attempt made over years could run hundreds to millions of such attacks.

The risk for brute force attacks is largely mitigated by password complexity, lockout attempts, the amount of time an account is locked out, and maintaining username confidentiality. Using these controls will make these attacks so time-intensive they become infeasible.

TraceSecurity recommends utilizing multiple strategies to lessen the chance of a compromise by offline brute force attacks against passwords.  The organization should enforce the requirement of passphrases with a minimum of 24 characters in length or complex passwords with a minimum of 10 characters in length, periodic password changes, and limit the use of re-used passwords.  Multi-factor authentication which usually requires the user to enter a password as well as present something they possess or present a bio trait can be utilized in place of the password complexity requirements
